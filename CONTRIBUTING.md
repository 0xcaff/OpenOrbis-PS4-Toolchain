Below is a list of issues that need some help. There are three lists; advanced issues, intermediate issues, and starter issues. Starter issues are issues that can be picked up and worked on without too much hassle or setup. Intermediate issues may require some digging. Advanced issues likely require a lot of work. Issues listed as "perpetual" are issues that don't have a clear stopping point
and will be worked on throughout the life of the toolchain.
